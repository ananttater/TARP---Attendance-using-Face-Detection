# TARP---Attendance-using-Face-Detection

Using cv2, face_recognition we have found 128 measurement for each face. Then we have encoded every face according to that. Now every time we recognise the face we will put the persons name and the time he appeared in the excel sheet.


to start the project you need to run this command in your terminal - **streamlit run streamlit_local_app.py**
